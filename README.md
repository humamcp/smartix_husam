## Implemented Technologies & Methodology
- The application uses bloc architecture using flutter_bloc package
- The application uses a feature-driven directory structure. This project structure enables us to scale the project by having self-contained features. In this app we only have a three features (home, devices & routines) but in more complex applications we can have hundreds of different features.
- Every feature has file with same name of folder and contain exports for all feature main files
